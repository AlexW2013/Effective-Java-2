/*
    Tips for naming methods in an API:
    1. Choose method names carefully. Names should obey standard naming conventions, and should be understandable and
    consistent throughout your project

    2. Dont go overboard in providing convenience methods. Too many methods can be a clutter; only provide
    convenience methods if they will be used often.

    3. Avoid long parameter lists, generally four or less. Reasons include easy of understanding for readers
    of the document, along with programmers possibly forgetting the order of parameters.
